    <p>I was born and raised in Germany, which gives me a unique out look on live. I moved to the States when I was 20 years old to join the Army. I was a Signal Support Specialist. After my tour was up, I chose to raise my kids and become a stay at home mom. My last job was a manager at Wafflehouse. My greatest asset is customer retention. I comunicate well with a wide array of people. </p>
