    <h1>About me</h1>
   
    <p>I, Irene Williams was born and raised in Germany, which gives me a unique out look on live. I moved to the States when I was 20 years old to join the Army. I was a Signal Support Specialist. After my tour was up, I chose to raise my kids and become a stay at home mom. My last job was a manager at Wafflehouse. My greatest asset is customer retention and communication skills. I just recently completed a coding bootcamp hosted by the clubhou.se, they work closely together with Augusta Technical College. I have a BS in Accounting and a AS in Business Administration. </p>

        I enjoy learning and nothing brings me more joy to create something out of nothing. I love the fact that coding is so versitile and I never get bored. There is always more to explore and learn. I love working in a team environment, but also on solo projects.</p>
        <br>

    <p>
        I am a very happy and energetic person. I am very family orientated and love traveling. My next goal in the forseable future is to travel to Brazil. In my spare time I like to frezbee golf, jogging, hiking, bowling, batminton and anything that is physical and outdoors.
